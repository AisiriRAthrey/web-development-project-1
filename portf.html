        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student currently in my 4th semester, but my journey has always been intertwined with a love for coding. Just like Tony Stark's unwavering passion for technology in the Marvel movies, I've been captivated by the world of coding from an early age.
             With my academic foundation, I have acquired knowledge in programming languages like C, C++, MATLAB, and even ventured into the digital world of Verilog. You could say I'm somewhat of a "code-sorcerer" with a knack for turning lines of code into functional magic.
              What sets me apart is my constant pursuit of learning and adaptation. I'm currently expanding my skill set by delving into the realms of web development with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Just like how Iron Man continually upgrades his suit, I'm on a quest to level up my coding abilities, ensuring that I'm always equipped to tackle new challenges and create cutting-edge solutions in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>In my first project, a portfolio page, I'm embarking on an exciting journey into the world of web development. Although this is just the beginning, I refuse to give up; I see it as an opportunity for growth and self-improvement.

                My portfolio page is more than just a collection of code and design; it's a reflection of my determination and my willingness to learn and adapt. This project signifies my commitment to facing challenges head-on and using them as stepping stones to refine my skills.
                
                I understand that every seasoned web developer started somewhere, and this is my starting point. My first project represents the foundation upon which I will build a promising career in the digital realm. As I continue to learn and refine my skills, my portfolio page will serve as a tangible record of my progress, showcasing my dedication to excellence and the exciting journey that lies ahead.
